                The rules governing how markets are offered, managed and/or
                settled are not the same for every market on each product. In
                certain circumstances, a bet that is settled as a winner on one
                product may be settled as a loser on the other product (and vice
                versa). Additionally, different settlement rules may apply so
                that, for example, bets that are a winner on one product may be
                settled as a dead heat or be voided on the other product.
                Customers must ensure that they familiarise themselves with the
                relevant rules that apply to the bets that they place on the

                  Test Matches - (PLAYERS METER) Individual Batsmen Runs /

                  batsman or partnership runs shall be void if 50 full overs are
                  not bowled unless one team has won, is dismissed or declares
                  prior to that point. Bets on partnership totals make up when
                  the next wicket falls. If a batsman in the relevant
                  partnership retires hurt, the partnership is treated as
                  continuing between the remaining batsman and the batsman who
                  comes to the wicket. A partnership is also treated as being
                  ended by the end of an innings.

                  The Sites non-runner rule relates to the adjustment of odds on
                  bets already matched when a horse in a race is declared a
                  non-runner. In order to make the adjustment the Site applies a
                  reduction factor to the remaining runners. The reduction
                  factor allocated to a non-runner is a calculation (the details
                  of which are described below) of that horses chances of
                  winning (or being placed, etc as appropriate) and is applied

                  When the market is loaded each horse is given a reduction
                  factor, based on a forecast price, which is expressed as a
                  percentage. These reduction factors may be updated
                  periodically at the discretion of the Site based on trading in
                  the market, but after approximately 15 minutes (approximately
                  5 minutes for Australian and US markets) from the scheduled
                  off time of a given race, they will be updated only in

                  Reductions will be made to both win and place markets but
                  applied differently (as described below), and horses will have
                  a different reduction factor for each market.
                </li>
                <li>
                  As soon as the Site becomes aware that a horse is an official
                  non-runner or a highly likely non-runner, following a
                  statement to the press from connections, the following will
                  happen:
                  <ul className="list-circle leading-normal pl-6">
                    <li>
                      All matched bets on that horse will be void and the horse
                      will be removed from the market.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      In the win market: if the reduction factor of the
                      non-runner is 2.5% or greater, the traded price of all the
                      matched bets on the remaining horses will be reduced by an
                      amount equal to the non-runners final reduction factor and
                      all the unmatched offers to lay will be cancelled. If the
                      non-runners reduction factor is less than 2.5%, reductions
                      will not be applied and unmatched bets will not be
                      cancelled.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      In the place market the reduction factor of all
                      non-runners will be applied (even if less than 2.5%) and
                      the potential winnings in relation to matched bets on the
                      remaining horses will be reduced by an amount equal to the
                      non-runners final reduction factor. Only if the
                      non-runners reduction factor is 4.0% or greater will all
                      the unmatched offers to lay be cancelled.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      All the reduction factors on the remaining horses will be
                      adjusted to reflect their improved chance of winning.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Reduction factors are not applied to bets which are struck
                  in-play. However, if a market is turned in-play prematurely by
                  error (or, for example, there is a false start), all bets
                  matched during this time will be subject to any later
                  reduction factor, provided the market is turned out of play
                  before the race commences. In the event of a late withdrawal,
                  the Site reserves the right to remove the runner after
                  completion of the race. In this case only those bets matched
                  prior to the off will be affected by a reduction factor.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In the event of a non-runner being removed from a race in
                  error or following incorrect information regarding a runners
                  participation, the Site will reinstate both the runner and all
                  previously matched bets associated with that runner. All bets
                  made between the time of withdrawal and reinstatement will be
                  void in both the place market and the win market. The
                  reduction factor applied to matched bets at the time of
                  withdrawal will be reversed and the original prices will
                  become valid.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Any non-runners will be removed from the relevant markets in
                  the order in which they are brought to the Sites attention. If
                  the Site becomes aware of more than one non-runner at the same
                  time, it will remove the non-runners from the relevant markets
                  in racecard order.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a runner is not included in a market because of an error or
                  because of incorrect information regarding a runners
                  participation, the Site reserves the right to introduce the
                  missing runner into the market at any time prior to settlement
                  (even after the race has been run), provided that the Site has
                  determined that the missing runner is not a material runner
                  (i.e. a selection with a reduction factor of approx. 2.5% or
                  less in the win market). In such circumstances, all pre-play
                  unmatched and matched bets will stand, however if the runner
                  is not introduced before the start of the race, all in-play
                  bets will be void. However, if the missing runner is deemed to
                  be a material runner, then the malformed market will be void
                  and a new market will be loaded where possible.

                  In the win market, reductions will be made on the traded
                  price.
                  <span className="block my-1 italic text-justify leading-tight">
                    For example: if the non-runners final reduction factor is
                    25% the traded price on all previously matched bets on other
                    horses will be reduced by 25% - traded price of 8.0 would
                    become 6.0 etc. And these might be further reduced if
                    another horse is subsequently declared a non-runner.

                    become 6.0. If the each Way terms were 1/5th odds for 3
                    places, the corresponding price for the Place portion of the
                    bet would reduce from 2.4 to 2.0.

                <li>
                  In the place market, reductions will be made to the potential
                  winnings on the bet only, and not the traded price.
                  <span className="block my-1 italic text-justify leading-tight">

                    the other horses will be reduced by 25% - a traded price of
                    8.0 would become 6.25.

                  <span className="block my-1 italic text-justify leading-tight">
                    For example a £10 bet on a horse to be placed at a traded
                    price of 8.0 would provide winnings of £70. If there is a
                    non-runner with a reduction factor of 25% in the race, that
                    factor will be applied to the £70 of potential winnings
                    leaving potential winnings of £52.50. Therefore the revised
                    traded price will be 6.25.

                  The traded price may be further reduced if any other horse(s)
                  is subsequently declared a non-runner, however odds cannot be
                  reduced below 1.01.

                  Reserves: A reserve runner may appear in the relevant markets
                  but will have a non-applicable reduction factor until the Site

                  which case an applicable reduction factor may apply to it.

                <li>
                  For the avoidance of doubt, any reduction factor applicable to
                  a non-runner replaced by a reserve, will be applied to all
                  bets struck on the relevant markets, prior to the removal from
                  those markets of such non-runner by the Site. Likewise, should
                  a reserve runner become a confirmed runner but subsequently
                  become a non-runner, any reduction factor applicable to such
                  non-runner will be applied to all bets struck on the relevant
